# Stereo App Wireframes: Designing for an Immersive Music Experience
## Overview
This repository showcases the wireframes I created for the Stereo app on both desktop and mobile platforms. These designs were crafted using Figma, a versatile tool for UI/UX design. The goal was to visualize an intuitive and engaging interface that enhances the user experience for music enthusiasts.

Creating these wireframes allowed me to conceptualize the app’s features, refine its layout, and focus on user interaction details, laying the groundwork for a robust and aesthetically pleasing application.
