# On why you should choose me:
Programming has always been a keen interest of mine and I always pounce on any oppurtunity I get to broaden my skills and expertise. I had attended numerous coding competitions during my highschool years
and also took interest in web development during my spare time. The hit of dopamine one gets on successfully completing a project or seeing your code flourish is what pushes me. I also enjoy taking part in
leadership roles and helping other members/ classmates, which would make me a strong candidate for contributing to the club's success. "I'm truly excited about the club's mission to promote a healthy coding, 
environment and oppurtunities to venture beyond whats known and I'm eager to contribute my efforts to support this cause.

# Goals for next 6 Months:
My goal as for the upcoming months would be to broaden my horizons on what i know interms of learning new languages and expand my skillset. To accomplish this task i am willing to put constant effort each day
to learn something new and step out of my comfort zone.

# Contributing Back to the club:
Through my unwavering determination and open mindedness to new ideas and concepts i would try to put forward new innovative projects to work on as well as encourage fellow batchmates to foster a love for 
programming and discovery.
